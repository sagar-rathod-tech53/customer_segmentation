# Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

## Project Overview

This project performs Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning Unsupervised Learning techniques. The objective is to group customers with similar purchasing behavior into meaningful segments that can help businesses improve marketing strategies, customer retention, and sales performance.

The project uses clustering algorithms such as:

* K-Means Clustering
* Hierarchical Clustering
* DBSCAN

A Streamlit web application is provided to predict the customer segment based on customer purchasing information.

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains customer transaction information including:

* Invoice Number
* Stock Code
* Product Description
* Quantity
* Invoice Date
* Unit Price
* Customer ID
* Country

Feature engineering is applied to generate:

* Revenue = Quantity × Unit Price
* Encoded Country Information

### Phase 5: Streamlit Deployment

Interactive web application that:

* Accepts customer details
* Performs preprocessing
* Predicts customer segment
* Displays cluster information
